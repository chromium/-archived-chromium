// ExceptionHandler
//
// ExceptionHandler can write a minidump file when an exception occurs,
// or when WriteMinidump() is called explicitly by your program.
//
// To have the exception handler write minidumps when an uncaught exception
// (crash) occurs, you should create an instance early in the execution
// of your program, and keep it around for the entire time you want to
// have crash handling active (typically, until shutdown).
// (NOTE): There should be only be one this kind of exception handler
// object per process.
//
// If you want to write minidumps without installing the exception handler,
// you can create an ExceptionHandler with install_handler set to false,
// then call WriteMinidump.  You can also use this technique if you want to
// use different minidump callbacks for different call sites.
//
// In either case, a callback function is called when a minidump is written,
// which receives the unqiue id of the minidump.  The caller can use this
// id to collect and write additional application state, and to launch an
// external crash-reporting application.
//
// Caller should try to make the callbacks as crash-friendly as possible,
// it should avoid use heap memory allocation as much as possible.
class ExceptionHandler {
 public:
  // A callback function to run before Breakpad performs any substantial
  // processing of an exception.  A FilterCallback is called before writing
  // a minidump.  context is the parameter supplied by the user as
  // callback_context when the handler was created.
  //
  // If a FilterCallback returns true, Breakpad will continue processing,
  // attempting to write a minidump.  If a FilterCallback returns false,
  // Breakpad  will immediately report the exception as unhandled without
  // writing a minidump, allowing another handler the opportunity to handle it.

  // file is <dump_path>\<minidump_id>.dmp.  context is the parameter supplied
  // by the user as callback_context when the handler was created.  succeeded
  // indicates whether a minidump file was successfully written.
  //
  // If an exception occurred and the callback returns true, Breakpad will
  // treat the exception as fully-handled, suppressing any other handlers from
  // being notified of the exception.  If the callback returns false, Breakpad
  // will treat the exception as unhandled, and allow another handler to handle
  // it. If there are no other handlers, Breakpad will report the exception to
  // the system as unhandled, allowing a debugger or native crash dialog the
  // opportunity to handle the exception.  Most callback implementations
  // should normally return the value of |succeeded|, or when they wish to
  // not report an exception of handled, false.  Callbacks will rarely want to
  // return true directly (unless |succeeded| is true).
