We include a snapshot of gmock from http://googlemock.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
with chromium.patch applied.

Current revision: 173


-- HOW TO USE --

If you are unfamiliar with gmock, there is an example of how to write a test
based on gmock in base/gmock_unittest.cc.  To use gmock, just add a dependency
onto testing/gmock.gyp:gmock in your gyp target.

For more general informaiton, there is a lot of good documentation availble on
the googlemock website:

  http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/

In particular, the "For Dummies" guide is a good place to start.  The
"CheatSheet" and "CookBook" are better as references.


-- RECREATING PACKAGE --

Starting with r173, gmock began distributing a pared down version of tr1 tuple
that can be used on compilers without TR1.  This means that we will no longer
need TR1 or boost on windows.

Recreating this package is now just exporting the wanted revision.
Example:

    svn export --ignore-externals \
        http://googlemock.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gmock

When checking out a copy from svn, --ignore-externals should be used to avoid
getting an extra copy of gtest.

This command will grab the head of trunk. Optionally, -r [revision number] to
can be passed to svn export if you want a specific revision.  The current
revision of the source is listed at the top of the README.
