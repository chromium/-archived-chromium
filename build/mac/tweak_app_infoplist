# Xcode supports build variable substitutions and CPP; sadly, that doesn't work
# because:
#
# 1. Xcode wants to do the Info.plist work before it runs any build phases,
#    this means if we were to generate a .h file for INFOPLIST_PREFIX_HEADER 
#    we'd have to put it in another target so it runs in time.
# 2. Xcode also doesn't check to see if the header being used as a prefix for
#    the Info.plist has changed.  So even if we updated it, it's only looking
#    at the modtime of the info.plist to see if that's changed.
#
# So, we work around all of this by making a script build phase that will run
# during the app build, and simply update the info.plist in place.  This way
# by the time the app target is done, the info.plist is correct.
