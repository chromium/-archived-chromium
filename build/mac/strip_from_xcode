# This is a handy wrapper script that figures out how to call the strip
# utility (strip_save_dsym in this case), if it even needs to be called at all,
# and then does it.  This script should be called by a post-link phase in
# targets that might generate Mach-O executables, dynamic libraries, or
# loadable bundles.
#
# An example "Strip If Needed" build phase placed after "Link Binary With
# Libraries" would do:
# exec "${XCODEPROJ_DEPTH}/build/mac/strip_from_xcode"

if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" != "Release" ] ; then
  # Only strip in release mode.
  exit 0
fi

# MACH_O_TYPE is not set for a command-line tool, so check PRODUCT_TYPE too.
# Weird.
