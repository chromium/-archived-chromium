// Animation
//
//  This class provides a basic implementation of an object that uses a timer
//  to increment its state over the specified time and frame-rate. To
//  actually do something useful with this you need to subclass it and override
//  AnimateToState and optionally GetCurrentValue to update your state.
//
//  The Animation notifies a delegate when events of interest occur.
//
//  The practice is to instantiate a subclass and call Init and any other
//  initialization specific to the subclass, and then call |Start|. The
//  animation uses the current thread's message loop.
//
