// The MessageRouter handles all incoming messages sent to it by routing them
// to the correct listener.  Routing is based on the Message's routing ID.
// Since routing IDs are typically assigned asynchronously by the browser
// process, the MessageRouter has the notion of pending IDs for listeners that
// have not yet been assigned a routing ID.
//
// When a message arrives, the routing ID is used to index the set of routes to
// find a listener.  If a listener is found, then the message is passed to it.
// Otherwise, the message is ignored if its routing ID is not equal to
// MSG_ROUTING_CONTROL.
//
// The MessageRouter supports the IPC::Message::Sender interface for outgoing
// messages, but does not define a meaningful implementation of it.  The
// subclass of MessageRouter is intended to provide that if appropriate.
//
// The MessageRouter can be used as a concrete class provided its Send method
// is not called and it does not receive any control messages.
