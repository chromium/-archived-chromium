// reason is that NSAM() never returns, which would leave all the objects
// currently on the stack in scoped_ptrs hanging and never cleaned up. We then

// the MessageLoop API, which works out ok for us because it's a wrapper around

  // allows subprocesses (created with a relaunch of our binary) to
  // create an NSApplication without showing up in the dock.
  // Subprocesses (such as the renderer) need an NSApplication for
  // Cocoa happiness However, for the browser itself, we DO want it in
  // the dock.  These 3 lines make it happen.
