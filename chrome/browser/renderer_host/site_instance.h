//
// SiteInstance class
//
// A SiteInstance is a data structure that is associated with all pages in a
// given instance of a web site.  Here, a web site is identified by its
// registered domain name and scheme.  An instance includes all pages
// that are connected (i.e., either a user or a script navigated from one
// to the other).  We represent instances using the BrowsingInstance class.
//
// In --process-per-tab, one SiteInstance is created for each tab (i.e., in the
// TabContents constructor), unless the tab is created by script (i.e., in
// TabContents::CreateNewView).  This corresponds to one process per
// BrowsingInstance.
//
// In process-per-site-instance (the current default process model),
// SiteInstances are created (1) when the user manually creates a new tab
// (which also creates a new BrowsingInstance), and (2) when the user navigates
// across site boundaries (which uses the same BrowsingInstance).  If the user
// navigates within a site, or opens links in new tabs within a site, the same
// SiteInstance is used.
//
// In --process-per-site, we consolidate all SiteInstances for a given site,
// throughout the entire profile.  This ensures that only one process will be
// dedicated to each site.
//
// Each NavigationEntry for a TabContents points to the SiteInstance that
// rendered it.  Each RenderViewHost also points to the SiteInstance that it is
// associated with.  A SiteInstance keeps track of the number of these
// references and deletes itself when the count goes to zero.  This means that
// a SiteInstance is only live as long as it is accessible, either from new
// tabs with no NavigationEntries or in NavigationEntries in the history.
