// This class manages the browser side of a browser<->renderer HWND connection.
// The HWND lives in the browser process, and windows events are sent over
// IPC to the corresponding object in the renderer.  The renderer paints into
// shared memory, which we transfer to a backing store and blit to the screen
// when Windows sends us a WM_PAINT message.
//
// How Shutdown Works
//
// There are two situations in which this object, a RenderWidgetHost, can be
// instantiated:
//
// 1. By a TabContents as the communication conduit for a rendered web page.
//    The TabContents instantiates a derived class: RenderViewHost.
// 2. By a TabContents as the communication conduit for a select widget. The
//    TabContents instantiates the RenderWidgetHost directly.
//
// For every TabContents there are several objects in play that need to be
// properly destroyed or cleaned up when certain events occur.
//
// - TabContents - the TabContents itself, and its associated HWND.
// - RenderViewHost - representing the communication conduit with the child
//   process.
// - RenderWidgetHostView - the view of the web page content, message handler,
//   and plugin root.
//
// Normally, the TabContents contains a child RenderWidgetHostView that renders
// the contents of the loaded page. It has a WS_CLIPCHILDREN style so that it
// does no painting of its own.
//
// The lifetime of the RenderWidgetHostView is tied to the render process. If
// the render process dies, the RenderWidgetHostView goes away and all
// references to it must become NULL. If the TabContents finds itself without a
// RenderWidgetHostView, it paints Sad Tab instead.
//
// RenderViewHost (a RenderWidgetHost subclass) is the conduit used to
// communicate with the RenderView and is owned by the TabContents. If the
// render process crashes, the RenderViewHost remains and restarts the render
// process if needed to continue navigation.
//
// The TabContents is itself owned by the NavigationController in which it
// resides.
//
// Some examples of how shutdown works:
//
// When a tab is closed (either by the user, the web page calling window.close,
// etc) the TabStrip destroys the associated NavigationController, which calls
// Destroy on each TabContents it owns.
//
// For a TabContents, its Destroy method tells the RenderViewHost to
// shut down the render process and die.
//
// When the render process is destroyed it destroys the View: the
// RenderWidgetHostView, which destroys its HWND and deletes that object.
//
// For select popups, the situation is a little different. The RenderWidgetHost
// associated with the select popup owns the view and itself (is responsible
// for destroying itself when the view is closed). The TabContents's only
// responsibility is to select popups is to create them when it is told to. When
// the View is destroyed via an IPC message (for when WebCore destroys the
// popup, e.g. if the user selects one of the options), or because
// WM_CANCELMODE is received by the view, the View schedules the destruction of
// the render process. However in this case since there's no TabContents
// container, when the render process is destroyed, the RenderWidgetHost just
// deletes itself, which is safe because no one else should have any references
// to it (the TabContents does not).
//
// It should be noted that the RenderViewHost, not the RenderWidgetHost,
// handles IPC messages relating to the render process going away, since the
// way a RenderViewHost (TabContents) handles the process dying is different to
// the way a select popup does. As such the RenderWidgetHostView handles these
// messages for select popups. This placement is more out of convenience than
// anything else. When the view is live, these messages are forwarded to it by
// the RenderWidgetHost's IPC message map.
