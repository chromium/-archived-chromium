// DrawThemeBackground is that it only draws horizontally, but by extracting
// the colors at two points on the X axis of a background drawn
// by DrawThemeBackground, we can construct a LinearGradientBrush and draw
// such a gradient in any direction.
//
// The width parameter is the width of horizontal gradient that will be
// created to calculate the two colors. x1 and x2 are the two pixel positions
// along the X axis.
