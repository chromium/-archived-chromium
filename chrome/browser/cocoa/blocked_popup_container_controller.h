// Controller for the blocked popup view. Communicates with the cross-platform
// code via a C++ bridge class, below. The BlockedPopupContainer class doesn't
// really "own" the bridge, it just keeps a pointer to it and calls Destroy() on
// it when it's supposed to go away. As a result, this class needs to own itself
// (always keep an extra retain), and will autorelease itself (and the bridge
// which it owns) when the bridge gets a Destroy() message.
// TODO(pinkerton): Reverse the ownership if it makes more sense. I'm leaving
// it this way because I assume we eventually want this to be a
// NSViewController, and we usually have the Obj-C controller owning the
// bridge (rather than the other way around).
