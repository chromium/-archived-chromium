// To use this class, create an instance with the desired URL and a pointer to
// the object to be notified when the URL has been loaded:
//   URLFetcher* fetcher = new URLFetcher("http://www.google.com", this);
//
// Then, optionally set properties on this object, like the request context or
// extra headers:
//   fetcher->SetExtraRequestHeaders("X-Foo: bar");
//
// Finally, start the request:
//   fetcher->Start();
//
// The object you supply as a delegate must inherit from URLFetcher::Delegate;
// when the fetch is completed, OnURLFetchComplete() will be called with the
// resulting status and (if applicable) HTTP response code.  From that point
// until the original URLFetcher instance is destroyed, you may examine the
// provided status and data for the URL.  (You should copy these objects if you
// need them to live longer than the URLFetcher instance.)  If the URLFetcher
// instance is destroyed before the callback happens, the fetch will be
// canceled and no callback will occur.
//
// You may create the URLFetcher instance on any thread; OnURLFetchComplete()
// will be called back on the same thread you use to create the instance.
//
// NOTE: Take extra care when using URLFetcher in services that live on the
//       BrowserProcess; all URLFetcher instances need to be destroyed before
//       the IO thread goes away, since the URLFetcher destructor requests an
//       InvokeLater operation on that thread.
//
// NOTE: URLFetcher requests will NOT be intercepted.
