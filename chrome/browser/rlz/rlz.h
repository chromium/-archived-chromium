// RLZ is a library which is used to measure distribution scenarios.
// Its job is to record certain lifetime events in the registry and to send
// them encoded as a compact string at most once per day. The sent data does
// not contain information that can be used to identify a user or to infer
// browsing habits. The API in this file is a wrapper to rlz.dll which can be
// removed of the system with no adverse effects on chrome.
// For partner or bundled installs, the RLZ might send more information
// according to the terms disclosed in the EULA. In the Chromium build the
// rlz.dll is not present so all the functionality becomes no-ops.
