// This file defines the interface class AutocompleteEditView.  Each toolkit
// will implement the edit view differently, so that code is inherently
// platform specific.  However, the AutocompleteEditModel needs to do some
// communication with the view.  Since the model is shared between platforms,
// we need to define an interface that all view implementations will share.
