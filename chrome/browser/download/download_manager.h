//
// The DownloadManager object manages the process of downloading, including
// updates to the history system and providing the information for displaying
// the downloads view in the Destinations tab. There is one DownloadManager per
// active profile in Chrome.
//
// Each download is represented by a DownloadItem, and all DownloadItems
// are owned by the DownloadManager which maintains a global list of all
// downloads. DownloadItems are created when a user initiates a download,
// and exist for the duration of the browser life time.
//
// Download observers:
// Objects that are interested in notifications about new downloads, or progress
// updates for a given download must implement one of the download observer
// interfaces:
//   DownloadItem::Observer:
//     - allows observers to receive notifications about one download from start
//       to completion
//   DownloadManager::Observer:
//     - allows observers, primarily views, to be notified when changes to the
//       set of all downloads (such as new downloads, or deletes) occur
// Use AddObserver() / RemoveObserver() on the appropriate download object to
// receive state updates.
//
// Download state persistence:
// The DownloadManager uses the history service for storing persistent
// information about the state of all downloads. The history system maintains a
// separate table for this called 'downloads'. At the point that the
// DownloadManager is constructed, we query the history service for the state of
// all persisted downloads.
