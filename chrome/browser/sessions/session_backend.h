// SessionBackend is the backend used by BaseSessionService. It is responsible
// for maintaining two files:
// . The current file, which is the file commands passed to AppendCommands
//   get written to.
// . The last file. When created the current file is moved to the last
//   file.
//
// Each file contains an arbitrary set of commands supplied from
// BaseSessionService. A command consists of a unique id and a stream of bytes.
// SessionBackend does not use the id in anyway, that is used by
// BaseSessionService.
