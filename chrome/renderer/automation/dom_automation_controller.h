/* DomAutomationController class:
   Bound to Javascript window.domAutomationController object.
   At the very basic, this object makes any native value (string, numbers,
   boolean) from javascript available to the automation host in Cpp.
   Any renderer implementation that is built with this binding will allow the
   above facility.
   The intended use of this object is to expose the DOM Objects and their
   attributes to the automation host.

   A typical usage would be like following (JS code):

   var object = document.getElementById('some_id');
   window.domAutomationController.send(object.nodeName); // get the tag name

   For the exact mode of usage,
   refer AutomationProxyTest.*DomAutomationController tests.

   The class provides a single send method that can send variety of native
   javascript values. (NPString, Number(double), Boolean)

   The actual communication occurs in the following manner:

    TEST            MASTER          RENDERER
              (1)             (3)

   Legends:
   - AProxy = AutomationProxy
   - AProvider = AutomationProvider
   - DAController = DomAutomationController

   (0) Initialization step where DAController is bound to the renderer
       and the view_id of the renderer is supplied to the DAController for
       routing message in (5). (routing_id_)
   (1) A 'javascript:' url is sent from the test process to master as an IPC
       message. A unique routing id is generated at this stage (automation_id_)
   (2) The automation_id_ of step (1) is supplied to DAController by calling
       the bound method setAutomationId(). This is required for routing message
       in (6).
   (3) The 'javascript:' url is sent for execution by calling into
       Browser::LoadURL()
   (4) A callback is generated as a result of domAutomationController.send()
       into Cpp. The supplied value is received as a result of this callback.
   (5) The value received in (4) is sent to the master along with the
       stored automation_id_ as an IPC message. routing_id_ is used to route
       the message. (IPC messages, ViewHostMsg_*DomAutomation* )
   (6) The value and the automation_id_ is extracted out of the message received
       in (5). This value is relayed to AProxy using another IPC message.
       automation_id_ is used to route the message.
       (IPC messages, AutomationMsg_Dom*Response)
