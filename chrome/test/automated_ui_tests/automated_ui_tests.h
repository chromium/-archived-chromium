// This takes an input file of commands, which consist of a series of
// actions, and runs every command, reporting the status of each one
// to an output file once all the commands have been run.
//
// The input file should be an XML file that has a root of any name followed
// by a series of elements named "command" with child elements representing
// the various actions, in order, to be performed during each command. A
// command element can optionally include an "number" attribute to identify it.
//
// Example:
// <CommandList>
//  <command number="1"><NewTab/><Navigate/><OpenWindow/><Navigate/><Back/>
//  </command>
//  <command number="2"><NewTab/><Navigate/><Navigate/><Back/><Forward/>
//  </command>
//  <command number="3"><CloseTab/><OpenWindow/><NewTab/><Navigate/><CloseTab/>
//  </command>
// </CommandList>
//
// When the test is finished it will output results to the output file,
// overwriting any previous version of this file. The output file is an
// XML file which reports on each command, indicating whether it successfully
// ran and if there were any errors.
//
// Example: (actual output will probably contain more actions per command):
// <Report>
//  <Executed command_number="1"><NewTab/><Navigate/><result><success/>
//  </result> </Executed>
//  <Executed command_number="2"><Back/><Forward/><result><success/></result>
//  </Executed>
//  <Executed command_number="3"><CloseTab/><result>
//    <crash crash_dump="C:\a_crash.txt" command_completed="no"/></result>
//  </Executed>
//  </Report>
//
// A "crash" result will have two attributes, crash_dump, which points
// to the full path of crash dump associated with this crash, and
// command_completed which indicates whether or not the last
// action recorded was the final action of the command.
//
// Furthermore, each individual action may contain additional attributes
// to log non-fatal failures. If the attribute 'failed_to_complete="yes"'
// is present, then the action did not complete. If that attribute is present,
// an info, warning, or error attribute will also be present, and will contain
// a string describing the error. The presence of info means the failure was
// expected, probably due to a state making the action impossible to perform
// like trying to close the last remaining window. Warnings usually mean the
// action couldn't complete for an unknown and unexpected reason, but that the
// test state is probably fine. Errors are like warnings, but they mean the test
// state is probably incorrect, and more failures are likely to be caused by
// the same problem.
//
// Example of some failed actions:
// <CloseTab failed_to_complete="yes" info="would_have_exited_application"/>
// <Reload failed_to_complete="yes" warning="failed_to_apply_accelerator"/>
// <Star failed_to_complete="yes" error="browser_window_not_found"/>
//
//
// Switches
// --input : Specifies the input file, must be an absolute directory.
//          Default is "C:\automated_ui_tests.txt"
//
// --output : Specifies the output file, must be an absolute directory.
//           Default is "C:\automated_ui_tests_error_report.txt"
//
//
// Test reproduction options:
//
// If you're trying to reproduce the results from crash reports use the
// following switches
//
// --key : Specifies, via a comma delimited list, what actions to run. Examples:
//        --key=SetUp,ZoomPlus,Forward,History,Navigate,Back,TearDown
//        --key=SetUp,ZoomPlus
//        Note, the second key doesn't include a TearDown, that will
//        automatically be added if the result doesn't crash.
//
// --num-reproductions : Specifies the number of reproductions to run, the
//                       default is 1. Suggested use: run without this flag
//                       to see if we reproduce a crash, then run with the flag
//                       if there isn't a crash, to see if it might be a rare
//                       race condition that causes the crash.
//
//
// Debugging options:
//
// --debug : Will append each action that is performed to the output file, as
//          soon as the action is performed. If the program finishes, this file
//          will be overwritten with the normal results. This flag is used to
//          help debug the tests if they are crashing before they get a chance
//          to write their results to file.
//
// --wait-after-action : waits the specified amount of time (1s by default)
//                       after each action. Useful for debugging.
