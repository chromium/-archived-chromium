Benchmark Extension
-------------------
This extension provides basic page-level benchmarking into the browser.

With the extension installed you can test web pages and then compare
results in a subwindow.

Between each page load you can optionally clear idle http connections and
clear the cache so that page loads are more like the user experience
when first connecting to a site.

To use this benchmark, you'll need to run chrome with the the 
"--enable-benchmarking" flag.  This flag enables a v8-extension so that
the benchmark can clear idle connections and the cache.

The code found in the jst/ subdirectory is JSTemplate code from
http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/
