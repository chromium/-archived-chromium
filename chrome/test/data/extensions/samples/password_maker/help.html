<h2>About:</h2>
See the <a href="http://passwordmaker.sourceforge.net/index.html">PasswordMaker home page</a>.

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>When prompted with a site login page, press Alt+`.  This opens the PasswordMaker dialog, where you can configure your password hash settings and enter your Master Password.  Click "Accept" or press Enter within the Master Password field to close the dialog and fill in your site password.  Voila!

<h2>Saving your settings:</h2>
<p>Chrome extensions don't have any means of local storage at the moment, so you have to jump through a few hoops to save your settings.  Follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Press Alt+` to open the PasswordMaker dialog.
  <li>Configure your settings how you like.
  <li>Click the "Show Settings" button at the bottom of the dialog.
  <li>From the settings dialog that pops up, copy and paste the settings text into a file named 'settings.js' in the extension directory.
</ol>
