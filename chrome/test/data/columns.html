<h1>Column test</h1>

<p>This tests that we do multi-column layout and don't crash. The issue is
that WebKit creates a NULL platform graphics context pointer, and expects
GraphicsContext to work with it, disabling paint.</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid rgb(34, 136, 17); -webkit-column-count: 2;
-moz-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-rule: 2px solid rgb(34, 136, 17);
-moz-column-rule: 4px solid rgb(34, 136, 17)">WebKit now has some very basic
support for multiple columns from CSS3.  In fact, if you&#8217;re reading this
blog entry, you will see that it has been broken up into two columns in the
latest WebKit nightly and in Firefox.<br />

<div style="margin: 1em 0">The properties supported at this time are columns,
column-gap, column-count and column-width.  Column rules are not yet supported
and neither are column breaks.</div> At this time any stacking context children
like relative positioned content or content that uses opacity will position
impoperly (as though the column didn&#8217;t exist.  If you decide to use this
feature, watch out for that.<br /> <div style="margin-top:1em"><b>Update</b>:
Column rules are now supported.  This blog entry now has one!</div>
