Version: 4

Modifications:
  - Included v8_benchmark_uitest.js in run.html. This file provides an
    interface between the benchmark and the test automation.
  - Included json2.js, a parser/stringifier for JSON in JavaScript, in
    run.html. This is used to stringify results for consumption by the test
    automation.
  - Modified run.html to call automation functions as necessary.
