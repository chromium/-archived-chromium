http://webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9/sunspider.html

Version: 0.9

Modifications:
  - Included sunspider_uitest.js in sunspider-results.html. This file provides
    an interface between the benchmark and the test automation.
  - Included json2.js, a parser/stringifier for JSON in JavaScript, in
    sunspider-results.html. This is used to stringify results for consumption
    by the test automation.
  - Modified sunspider-results.html to call automation.SetDone() after the
    results have been analyzed.
