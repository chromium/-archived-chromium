// Base class for Views based tests that dispatch events.
//
// As views based event test involves waiting for events to be processed,
// writing a views based test is slightly different than that of writing
// other unit tests. In particular when the test fails or is done you need
// to stop the message loop. This can be done by way of invoking the Done
// method.
//
// Any delayed callbacks should be done by way of CreateEventTask.
// CreateEventTask checks to see if ASSERT_XXX has been invoked after invoking
// the task. If there was a failure Done is invoked and the test stops.
//
// ViewEventTestBase creates a Window with the View returned from
// CreateContentsView. The preferred size for the view can be customized by
// overriding GetPreferredSize. If you do not override GetPreferredSize the
// preferred size of the view returned from CreateContentsView is used.
//
// Subclasses of ViewEventTestBase must implement two methods:
// . DoTestOnMessageLoop: invoked when the message loop is running. Run your
//   test here, invoke Done when done.
// . CreateContentsView: returns the view to place in the window.
//
// Once you have created a ViewEventTestBase use the macro VIEW_TEST to define
// the fixture.
//
// I encountered weird timing problems in initiating dragging and drop that
// necessitated ugly hacks. In particular when the hook installed by
// ui_controls received the mouse event and posted a task that task was not
// processed. To work around this use the following pattern when initiating
// dnd:
//   // Schedule the mouse move at a location slightly different from where
//   // you really want to move to.
//   ui_controls::SendMouseMoveNotifyWhenDone(loc.x + 10, loc.y,
//       NewRunnableMethod(this, YYY));
//   // Then use this to schedule another mouse move.
//   ScheduleMouseMoveInBackground(loc.x, loc.y);
