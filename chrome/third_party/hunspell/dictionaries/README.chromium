This Folder contains the following:

.dic files
.aff files
.bdic files
.dic_delta files
README_??_??.txt files

The .bdic files are binary files, generated from the corresponding .dic and .aff files, using convert_dict (chrome\tools\convert_dict). These binary files are used by the spellchecker. The .dic_delta files are used to add words which are not there in the .dic files. Irrespective of the encoding of the corresponding .dic file, the .dic_delta files are encoded as UTF-8.

The final binary file, .bdic, is generated with words from the .dic and additional words from the .dic_delta file. In order to get the current-most bdic file versions, it is a good idea to rebuild them using convert_dict from the .dic, .aff and .dic_delta files in this folder. convert_dict takes care of duplicate entries present both in .dic and .dic_delta files.

The README_??_??.txt files contain information about the individual dictionaries, including copyright information.

The following 19 dictionaries have been appended with additional words using the .dic_delta files (January 5th 2009), and are covered under the existing GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license in ../COPYING:

have 8 or fewer conditions. See http://crbug.com/8551 for details.
