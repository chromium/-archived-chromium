Comment:       The FREE LGPL version of the dictionary file is based on version 2.2.1.

               The latest version of the dictionary can be found at http://www.JustLocal.com.au.
               Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Australian English spell check
               dictionaries.

               The FREE LGPL version is provided and is the full dictionary. In addition for clients
               and customers of JustLocal, Online Connections and those using the services of Virtual
               Profit Sharing partners, the latest free, but copyright, version is available. 

               Two versions of the Australian English spellcheck dictionary files are available.

               The full version and the Kelvin version.

               The Kelvin version aims to simplify the Australian English language by providing 
               the single preferred spelling of a word where there are multiple spellings.

               For example the "ize" words often incorrectly considered American spelling have
               been removed from the Kelvin version.

               The full version is equivalent to a descriptive dictionary which is the common
               form of printed dictionary. With the dictionary it is up to you to decide which
               spelling of words such as organise/organize, focused/focussed you prefer. 

               The Kelvin version is equivalent to a prescriptive dictionary which guides you
               as to the preferred spelling in Australia. The Kelvin dictionary presents you 
               only with the preferred version of the spelling as being correct. That is organise
               and focused are correct, and organize and focussed are considered incorrect. The
               Kelvin version leads to consistent use of spelling within a document.

               The choice is yours as to which dictionary you prefer.

Feedback

If you find omissions or bugs please let me know.

If you wish to suggest new words to be added to the dictionary, please assist by first fully 
researching the words before providing them.

You can contact me using the form available on the dictionary page.
Visit www.JustLocal.com.au, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Australian English
spellcheck dictionary files. On this page is a form you can use to contact me.
The form is the best way to contact me as it ensures I receive your information. I receive thousands
of undesirable emails as year and whilst I visually check the summary of all emails, sending an 
email direct could end up with your email being treated as potential spam or malware.
