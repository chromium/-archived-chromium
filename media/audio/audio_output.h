// Low-level audio output support. To make sound there are 3 objects involved:
// - AudioSource : produces audio samples on a pull model. Implements
//   the AudioSourceCallback interface.
// - AudioOutputStream : uses the AudioSource to render audio on a given
//   channel, format and sample frequency configuration. Data from the
//   AudioSource is delivered in a 'pull' model.
// - AudioManager : factory for the AudioOutputStream objects, manager
//   of the hardware resources and mixer control.
//
// The number and configuration of AudioOutputStream does not need to match the
// physically available hardware resources. For example you can have:
//
//  MonoPCMSource1 --> MonoPCMStream1 --> |       | --> audio left channel
//  StereoPCMSource -> StereoPCMStream -> | mixer |
//  MonoPCMSource2 --> MonoPCMStream2 --> |       | --> audio right channel
//
// This facility's objective is mix and render audio with low overhead using
// the OS basic audio support, abstracting as much as possible the
// idiosyncrasies of each platform. Non-goals:
// - Positional, 3d audio
// - Dependence on non-default libraries such as DirectX 9, 10, XAudio
// - Digital signal processing or effects
// - Extra features if a specific hardware is installed (EAX, X-fi)
//
// The primary client of this facility is audio coming from several tabs.
// Specifically for this case we avoid supporting complex formats such as MP3
// or WMA. Complex format decoding should be done by the renderers.
