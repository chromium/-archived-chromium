// FieldTrial is a class for handling details of statistical experiments
// performed by actual users in the field (i.e., in a shipped or beta product).
// All code is called exclusively on the UI thread currently.
//
// The simplest example is an experiment to see whether one of two options
// produces "better" results across our user population.  In that scenario, UMA
// data is uploaded to aggregate the test results, and this FieldTrial class
// manages the state of each such experiment (state == which option was
// pseudo-randomly selected).
//
// States are typically generated randomly, either based on a one time
// randomization (generated randomly once, and then persistently reused in the
// client during each future run of the program), or by a startup randomization
// (generated each time the application starts up, but held constant during the
// duration of the process), or by continuous randomization across a run (where
// the state can be recalculated again and again, many times during a process).
// Only startup randomization is implemented thus far.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Example:  Suppose we have an experiment involving memory, such as determining
// the impact of memory model command line flags actual memory use.
// We assume that we already have a histogram of memory usage, such as:

//   HISTOGRAM_COUNTS("Memory.RendererTotal", count);

// Somewhere in main thread initialization code, we'd probably define an
// instance of a FieldTrial, with code such as:

// // Note, FieldTrials are reference counted, and persist automagically until
// // process teardown, courtesy of their automatic registration in
// // FieldTrialList.
// scoped_refptr<FieldTrial> trial = new FieldTrial("MemoryExperiment", 1000);
// int group1 = trial->AppendGroup("_high_mem", 20);  // 2% in _high_mem group.
// int group2 = trial->AppendGroup("_low_mem", 20);   // 2% in _low_mem group.
// // Take action depending of which group we randomly land in.
// if (trial->group() == group1)
//   SetMemoryModel(HIGH);  // Sample setting of browser state.
// else if (trial->group() == group2)
//   SetMemoryModel(LOW);  // Sample alternate setting.

// We then modify any histograms we wish to correlate with our experiment to
// have slighly different names, depending on what group the trial instance
// happened (randomly) to be assigned to:

// HISTOGRAM_COUNTS(FieldTrial::MakeName("Memory.RendererTotal",
//                                       "MemoryExperiment").data(), count);

// The above code will create 3 distinct histograms, with each run of the
// application being assigned to of of the three groups, and for each group, the
// correspondingly named histogram will be populated:

// Memory.RendererTotal            // 96% of users still fill this histogram.
// Memory.RendererTotal_high_mem   // 2% of users will fill this histogram.
// Memory.RendererTotal_low_mem    // 2% of users will fill this histogram.
