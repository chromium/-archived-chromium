// This file consist of lines with specifications of what
// to expect from layout test cases. The test cases can be directories
// in which case the expectations apply to all test cases in that
// directory and any subdirectory. The format of the file is along the
// lines of:
//
// LayoutTests/fast/js/fixme.js = FAIL
// LayoutTests/fast/js/flaky.js = FAIL PASS
// LayoutTests/fast/js/crash.js = CRASH TIMEOUT FAIL PASS
//
// To add other options:
// SKIP : LayoutTests/fast/js/no-good.js = TIMEOUT PASS
// DEBUG : LayoutTests/fast/js/no-good.js = TIMEOUT PASS
// DEBUG SKIP : LayoutTests/fast/js/no-good.js = TIMEOUT PASS
// LINUX DEBUG SKIP : LayoutTests/fast/js/no-good.js = TIMEOUT PASS
// DEFER LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/js/no-good.js = TIMEOUT PASS
//
// SKIP: Doesn't run the test.
// WONTFIX: For tests that we never intend to pass on a given platform.
// DEFER: Test does not count in our statistics for the current release.
// DEBUG: Expectations apply only to the debug build.
// RELEASE: Expectations apply only to release build.
// LINUX/WIN/MAC: Expectations apply only to these platforms.
//
// The format of a test line is as follows:
// METADATA : relative/path/to/test.html = EXPECTATIONS
//
// For example,
// LINUX : LayoutTests/media = PASS FAIL
//
// The above means that all the media tests are flaky, but only on Linux.
//
// Notes:
// -A test cannot be both DEFER and WONTFIX
// -A test can be included twice, but not via the same path.
// -If a test is included twice, then the more precise path wins.
// -CRASH tests cannot be DEFER or WONTFIX
