This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

paste-text-013-expected.txt
--------------------------
The Mac has more up-to-date expected results in
platform/mac/editing/pasteboard.  It looks like they forgot to update the
platform neutral results, which is what we picked up in the last merge.

subframe-dragndrop-1-expected.txt
---------------------------------
This test uses double click to select a word and drag it to a new location. 
We follow Windows convention and include the trailing space on double click.
