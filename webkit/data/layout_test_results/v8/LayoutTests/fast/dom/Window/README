This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

atob-btoa-expected.txt
--------------------------
window.btoa(window) calls window.toString first. KJS returns [object Window]
and V8 returns [object global].

element-constructors-on-window-exepcted.html
--------------------------
V8 has different output for HTMLElement.toString.

new-window-opener-expected.txt
------------------------------
It is a time-sensitive test. Chrome passes all tests, Safari failed some,
so the output expects some failures. Firefox sometimes passes all tests
and sometimes fails some. Use Chrome's output as the baseline.
