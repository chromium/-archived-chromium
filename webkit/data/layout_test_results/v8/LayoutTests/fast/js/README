This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

array-every.html
--------------------------
V8 has a more informative type error message when a non-function is
passed to Array.prototype.every.

array-foreach.html
--------------------------
V8 has a more informative type error message when a non-function is
passed to Array.prototype.foreach.

array-some.html
--------------------------
V8 has a more informative type error message when a non-function is
passed to Array.prototype.some.

assign.html
object-extra-comma.html
property-getters-and-setters.html
regexp-range-out-of-order.html
regexp-no-extensions.html
array-functions-non-arrays.html
--------------------------
Only error messages are different.

deep-recursion.html
--------------------------
It takes more than 1000 recursive calls to get a stack overflow in V8.

function-decompilation-operators.html
function-prototype.html
function-names.html
--------------------------
Output format of an empty function is different.

toString-and-valueOf-override-diff-win.txt
--------------------------
This test differs only in text.  V8 typeerror messages are slightly
different, and the global object is of type global instead of 'DOMWindow'

kde\crash-2-expected.txt
--------------------------
V8 prints "Stack overflow" to console.

cyclic-prototypes-expected.txt
--------------------------
Exception text is different in v8

prefix-syntax.html
postfix-syntax.html
--------------------------
V8 throws syntax errors at parse time whereas KJS throws reference
errors at runtime for invalid pre- and postfix syntax.

regexp-caching.html
--------------------------
The KJS behavior is a bug, http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16514

regexp-compile.html
--------------------------
We print the empty regexp differently (KJS: //, V8: /(?:)/), see
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225550

modify-non-reference.html
--------------------------
Only printing of functions and error messages differ.

toString-stack-overflow.html
--------------------------
KJS has an extra period "." after the error message.  V8 does not.

recursion-limit-equal.html
regexp-compile-crash.html
regexp-charclass-crash.html
--------------------------
Only difference is error message written to the console.

number-toString
--------------------------
We generate rather big representation in radices different from 10.  
So does KJS.  The difference is the arbitrary number of digits 
generated (we generate a bit more than KJS).  Also, KJS has an arbitrary 
delta that they check for during conversion - this sometimes allow them 
to generate a shorter representation (however, it is still the wrong 
solution).  We are no worse than KJS.

number-to-precision
number-to-fixed
--------------------------
We trust dtoa to give us the right decimal representation of 
floating-point numbers.  KJS apparently does something else.
Our behavior is consistent with Firefox (and is what the test
expects).

number-to-exponential
--------------------------
We trust dtoa to give us the right decimal representation of 
floating-point numbers.  KJS apparently does something else.
Our behavior is consistent with Firefox (and is what the test
expects).  In addition, KJS has an inconsistent error message
for out of range arguments to toExponential.
