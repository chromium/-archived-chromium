This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

select-namedItem.html
---------------------
The test throws an exception on accessing the 'innerHTML' property of a null
pointer. The spec says e.message is implementation-dependent in that case.
V8 has the same implementation as Firefox.  See bug 868016.

selected-index-assert.html
---------------------
Only the error message differ.
