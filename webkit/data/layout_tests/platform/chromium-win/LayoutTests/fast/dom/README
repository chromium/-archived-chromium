This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

prototype-chain-expected.txt
--------------------------
It is implementation specific. Harmless.

wrapper-classes
--------------------------
The printing of prototype objects and constructors is implementation dependent.
We print these differently from KJS which is harmless.  Also, we print the 
global object differently from KJS. 

global-constructor.txt
--------------------------
Node function is implementation specific. In V8 it is a function, and 
Node.prototype cannot be deleted. In KJS, Node is an object, and Node.prototype
can be deleted.

undetectable-document-all 
-------------------------- 
document.all is undectable which means that it behaves like undefined
except when accessing properties on the object.  In KJS document.all
prints as '[object HTMLCollection]'.  In V8 document.all behaves like
undefined also when printed so it prints as 'undefined'.

xmlhttprequest-get
------------------
The only difference is that V8 prints functions slightly differently.
