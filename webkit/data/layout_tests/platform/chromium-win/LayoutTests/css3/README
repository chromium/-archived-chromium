--------------------------
The printing of prototype objects and constructors is implementation dependent.
We print these differently from KJS which is harmless.

--------------------------
Expects typeof(CSSStyleDeclaration) to be 'object'.  In V8 this is a
constructor function and typeof(CSSStyleDeclaration) is 'function'.
