This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

cross-frame-access-location-get-override-expected.txt
cross-frame-access-location-put-expected.txt
cross-frame-access-put-expected.txt
===============================================================
Due to different output message.


cross-frame-access-history-get-expected.txt
===============================================================
Chrome does not allow cross-domain access History.toString,
same as Firefox.

cross-frame-access-history-put-expected.txt
===============================================================
Differs in function printing.

cross-frame-access-call-expected.txt
===============================================================
Error message differs because we don't have window.openDatabase.
The error message from showModalDialog is more sane than the layout tests expect.

xss-eval-expected.txt
===============================================================
Differs only in error message. LayoutTest expects an EvalError where we detect
and report an xss attempt.
