verify-ssl-enabled.php
----------------------------------------
This calls dumpAsText() and shouldn't be producing a .png file at all, but
something about its failure mode now that we're running Apache2 with SSL is
causing it to miss the dumpAsText() call.  This "expected" image and checksum
makes the script happy until we can fix the test.
