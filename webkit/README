OVERVIEW

  port/    - contains our fork of WebCore Windows-specific bits.

  glue/    - contains our embedding API for WebCore, based loosely on WebKit's
             COM API (but w/o any COM).

  build/   - contains our vcproj files for WebKit source and port+glue

  pending/ - contains cross-platform files from {Web,JavaScript}Core that we
             have temporarily forked until the changes are incorporated into
             webkit.org's repository.

  activex_shim/ - contains a plugin shim to support ActiveX controls.
  
CODING STYLE

  The contents of port/ should stick to WebKit coding conventions since they
  may ultimately be contributed to webkit.org as an alternate Windows port.

  The contents of glue/ should stick to Google coding conventions since they
  are designed for use by Chrome and possibly other Google apps.
