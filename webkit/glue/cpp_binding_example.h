  CppBindingExample class:
  This provides an example of how to use the CppBoundClass to create methods
  and properties that can be exposed to JavaScript by an appropriately built
  embedding client. It is also used by the CppBoundClass unit test.

  Typically, a class intended to be bound to JavaScript will define a
  constructor, any methods and properties to be exposed, and optionally a
  destructor.  An embedding client can then bind the class to a JavaScript
  object in a frame's window using the CppBoundClass::BindToJavascript() method,
  generally called from the WebView delegate's WindowObjectCleared().

  Once this class has been bound, say to the name "example", it might be called
  from JavaScript in the following way:

  <script>
    if (window.example) {
      document.writeln(example.echoValue(false));
      document.writeln(example.echoType("Hello world!"));
      document.writeln(example.plus(2, 3.1));

      example.my_value = 15;
      example.my_other_value = 2.1;
      document.writeln(example.plus(example.my_value, example.my_other_value));
    }
  </script>
*/

  //
  // These public member variables and methods implement the methods and
  // properties that will be exposed to JavaScript. If needed, the class could
  // also contain other methods or variables, which will be hidden from JS
  // as long as they're not mapped in the property and method lists created in
  // the constructor.

  // Returns a hard-coded value of the same type (bool, number (double),
  // string, or null) that was passed in as an argument.

  // Returns the sum of the (first) two arguments as a double, if they are both
  // numbers (integers or doubles).  Otherwise returns null.
