README for samples/shaders

This directory contains files of shader code. In order to use them, they should
be loaded into an html textarea in your application or loaded using
o3djs.effect.loadEffect. NOTE: o3djs.effect.loadEffect can only load
files from the same domain as the application webpage and the files must be at
or below the current directory of the webpage

The purpose of this directory is not to be *the* library of shaders, but to
provide some sample shaders as examples and starting points for people to build
their own.

Each shader has its own requirements. Some shaders need different streams or
require certain types of texture samplers so a shader will not work with just
any 3d object. Look at the shader and determine what its requirements are before
using it in your application.
