// The pulley joint is connected to two bodies and two fixed ground points.

// length1 + ratio * length2 = constant
// Yes, the force transmitted is scaled by the ratio.
// The pulley also enforces a maximum length limit on both sides. This is
// useful to prevent one side of the pulley hitting the top.
