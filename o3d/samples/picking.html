O3D Picking Example.

This example shows one way to implement picking. Because O3D is shader
agnostic we can't handle picking automatically since we have no way of knowing
what the developer is going to do with their shaders. On the other hand, we can
provide various functions that make it possible to do your own picking. Only you
know which objects are pickable and which are not. For example if you are
making an RTS game, only you would know that units are pickable but ground and
explosions are not and that neither is your HUD.

It's possible that someone, maybe us, will create an engine to use o3d
that given a bunch of restrictions and flags on the data it excepts can
do picking in a more automatic way but that is not the goal of the o3d api.
Its goal is to provide a LOW-LEVEL shader agnostic API.
