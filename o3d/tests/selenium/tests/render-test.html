Render Test

Make sure that if client.render() is called multiple times it is only rendered
once. client.render() should only flag that the client needs to be rendered and
the system (browser + plugin) should render it the next time it's time to
render. It should NOT render immediately therefore multiple calls to
client.render() without returning to the browser should only make it render
once.
