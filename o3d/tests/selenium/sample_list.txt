#
# Test Requirements:
#
#   Each sample is expected to have a global variable called g_finished
#   that is set to true when the sample has finish initalizing and is ready
#   for a screenshot.
#
# Line Format:
#
#   TestType test-name options
#
# Valid TestTypes are:
#
#   small
#   medium
#   large
#
# options are separated by spaces.
#   screenshot : take a screenshot.  You can specify a time with
#       screenshot(seconds) as in screenshot(4), take it at the 4 second mark.
#       You can also specify more than 1 screenshot by specifying more than
#       one screenshot option as in "screenshot(4), screenshot(6.5). If no time
#       is specified 27.5 is used.
#
#       To take a screenshot the test must have a global variable "g_client"
#       that is the client plugin object from which to take a screenshot.
#
#       If the sample is animated, it is expected to have a global variable
#       called g_timeMult that can be set to 0 to stop the animation.  All of
#       its animation must be based on a global variable called g_clock, such
#       that setting g_clock to the same value will always produce the same
#       image.
#
#   timeout(milliseconds) : Set the timeout to wait for readiness.
#       Default 10000.
#
#   client(client_variable_name) : Name of client variable in javascript.
#       Default = "g_client"
#
#   pdiff_threshold_mac(number_of_pixels_allowed)
#   pdiff_threshold_win(number_of_pixels_allowed)
#   pdiff_threshold_linux(number_of_pixels_allowed)
#   pdiff_threshold(number_of_pixels_allowed) : Number of pixels
#       allowed to be perceptually different before the test fails.
#       "pdiff_threshold" specifies the threshold for all
#       platforms.  Platform specific versions override the
#       threshold for that platform.  The default threshold is 10 pixels.
#
#   except(*firefox, *iexplore, *googlechrome) : Name of the browser
#       environment(s) where the test should be skipped.
#       Default = ""
#
#   colorfactor(0 to 1) : Determines how important color is for comparison. A
#       value of 1 means they must be exactly the same; a value of 0 means it
#       won't factor in at all.
#
#   downsample(number_of_times_to_halve_resolution) : The resolution will be
#       cut in half this number of times before comparing. It is useful for
#       eliminating aliasing artifacts since such differences are less
#       noticeable at the lower resolution. Be careful with using this parameter
#       as it may mask other problems.
