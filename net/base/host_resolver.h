class HostMapper;

// This class represents the task of resolving hostnames (or IP address
// literal) to an AddressList object.
//
// HostResolver handles multiple requests at a time, so when cancelling a
// request the Request* handle that was returned by Resolve() needs to be
// given.  A simpler alternative for consumers that only have 1 outstanding
// request at a time is to create a SingleRequestHostResolver wrapper around
// HostResolver (which will automatically cancel the single request when it
// goes out of scope).
//
// For each hostname that is requested, HostResolver creates a
// HostResolver::Job. This job gets dispatched to a thread in the global
// WorkerPool, where it runs "getaddrinfo(hostname)". If requests for that same
// host are made while the job is already outstanding, then they are attached
// to the existing job rather than creating a new one. This avoids doing
// parallel resolves for the same host.
//
// The way these classes fit together is illustrated by:
//
//
//            +------------- HostResolver ---------------+
//            |                    |                     |
//           Job                  Job                   Job
//       (for host1)          (for host2)           (for hostX)
//       /    |   |            /   |   |             /   |   |
//   Request ... Request  Request ... Request   Request ... Request
//  (port1)     (port2)  (port3)      (port4)  (port5)      (portX)
//
//
// When a HostResolver::Job finishes its work in the threadpool, the callbacks
// of each waiting request are run on the origin thread.
//
// Thread safety: This class is not threadsafe, and must only be called
// from one thread!
