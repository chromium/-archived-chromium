"""Usage: <win-path-to-pdb.pdb>
This tool will take a PDB on the command line, extract the source files that
were used in building the PDB, query SVN for which repository and revision
these files are at, and then finally write this information back into the PDB
in a format that the debugging tools understand.  This allows for automatic
source debugging, as all of the information is contained in the PDB, and the
debugger can go out and fetch the source files via SVN.

You most likely want to run these immediately after a build, since the source
input files need to match the generated PDB, and we want the correct SVN
revision information for the exact files that were used for the build.

The following files from a windbg + source server installation are expected
to reside in the same directory as this python script:
  dbghelp.dll
  pdbstr.exe
  srctool.exe

NOTE: Expected to run under a native win32 python, NOT cygwin.  All paths are
dealt with as win32 paths, since we have to interact with the Microsoft tools.
