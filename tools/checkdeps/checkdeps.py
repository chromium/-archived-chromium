"""Makes sure that files include headers from allowed directories.

Checks DEPS files in the source tree for rules, and applies those rules to
"#include" commands in source files. Any source file including something not
permitted by the DEPS files will fail.

The format of the deps file:

First you have the normal module-level deps. These are the ones used by
gclient. An example would be:

  deps = {
    "base":"http://foo.bar/trunk/base"
  }

DEPS files not in the top-level of a module won't need this. Then you have
any additional include rules. You can add (using "+") or subtract (using "-")
from the previously specified rules (including module-level deps).

  include_rules = {
    # Code should be able to use base (it's specified in the module-level
    # deps above), but nothing in "base/evil" because it's evil.
    "-base/evil",

    # But this one subdirectory of evil is OK.
    "+base/evil/not",

    # And it can include files from this other directory even though there is
    # no deps rule for it.
    "+tools/crime_fighter"
  }

DEPS files may be placed anywhere in the tree. Each one applies to all
subdirectories, where there may be more DEPS files that provide additions or
subtractions for their own sub-trees.

There is an implicit rule for the current directory (where the DEPS file lives)
and all of its subdirectories. This prevents you from having to explicitly
allow the current directory everywhere.  This implicit rule is applied first,
so you can modify or remove it using the normal include rules.

The rules are processed in order. This means you can explicitly allow a higher
directory and then take away permissions from sub-parts, or the reverse.

Note that all directory separators must be slashes (Unix-style) and not
backslashes. All directories should be relative to the source root and use
only lowercase.
