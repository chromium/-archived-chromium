// Implements a patching mechanism that overwrites the first few bytes of
// a function preamble with a jump to our hook function, which is then
// able to call the original function via a specially-made preamble-stub
// that imitates the action of the original preamble.
//
// NOTE:  This patching mechanism should currently only be used for
// non-production code, e.g. unit tests, because it is not threadsafe.
// See the TODO in preamble_patcher_with_stub.cc for instructions on what
// we need to do before using it in production code; it's fairly simple
// but unnecessary for now since we only intend to use it in unit tests.
//
// To patch a function, use either of the typesafe Patch() methods.  You
// can unpatch a function using Unpatch().
//
// Typical usage goes something like this:
// @code
// typedef int (*MyTypesafeFuncPtr)(int x);
// MyTypesafeFuncPtr original_func_stub;
// int MyTypesafeFunc(int x) { return x + 1; }
// int HookMyTypesafeFunc(int x) { return 1 + original_func_stub(x); }
//
// void MyPatchInitializingFunction() {
//   original_func_stub = PreamblePatcher::Patch(
//              MyTypesafeFunc, HookMyTypesafeFunc);
//   if (!original_func_stub) {
//     // ... error handling ...
//   }
//
//   // ... continue - you have patched the function successfully ...
// }
// @endcode
//
// Note that there are a number of ways that this method of patching can
// fail.  The most common are:
//    - If there is a jump (jxx) instruction in the first 5 bytes of
//    the function being patched, we cannot patch it because in the
//    current implementation we do not know how to rewrite relative
//    jumps after relocating them to the preamble-stub.  Note that
//    if you really really need to patch a function like this, it
//    would be possible to add this functionality (but at some cost).
//    - If there is a return (ret) instruction in the first 5 bytes
//    we cannot patch the function because it may not be long enough
//    for the jmp instruction we use to inject our patch.
//    - If there is another thread currently executing within the bytes
//    that are copied to the preamble stub, it will crash in an undefined
//    way.
//
// If you get any other error than the above, you're either pointing the
// patcher at an invalid instruction (e.g. into the middle of a multi-
// byte instruction, or not at memory containing executable instructions)
// or, there may be a bug in the disassembler we use to find
// instruction boundaries.
//
// NOTE:  In optimized builds, when you have very trivial functions that
// the compiler can reason do not have side effects, the compiler may
// reuse the result of calling the function with a given parameter, which
// may mean if you patch the function in between your patch will never get
// invoked.  See preamble_patcher_test.cc for an example.
