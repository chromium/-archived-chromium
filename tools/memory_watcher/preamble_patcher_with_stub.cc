  // method of making it safe, which is to freeze all other threads in the
  // process, check their thread context to see if their eip is currently
  // inside the block of instructions we need to copy to the stub, and if so
  // wait a bit and try again, then unfreeze all threads once we've patched.
  // Not implementing this for now since we're only using SideStep for unit
  // testing, but if we ever use it for production code this is what we
  // should do.
  //
  // NOTE: Stoyan suggests we can write 8 or even 10 bytes atomically using
  // FPU instructions, and on newer processors we could use cmpxchg8b or
  // cmpxchg16b. So it might be possible to do the patching/unpatching
  // atomically and avoid having to freeze other threads.  Note though, that
  // doing it atomically does not help if one of the other threads happens
  // to have its eip in the middle of the bytes you change while you change
