This is a small "web application" to display traceline trace data.  It uses
xhtml, SVG, and JavaScript to interpret the JSON data in a timeline format.
Events can be moused over to show details, stack traces, etc.

The name of the JSON file should be supplied behind a # in the URL.  Multiple
JSON files can be listed (comma separated), allowing you to compare multiple
sets of data.  Examples:

http://blah/traceline.xml#startup-release.json
http://blah/traceline.xml#mydata1.json,mydata2.json
