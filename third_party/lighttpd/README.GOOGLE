This is an import of a cygwin-based lighttpd for windows from:

LightTPD-1.4.19-1-Win32-SSL.exe (http://en.wlmp-project.net/)
LightTPD-1.4.20.tar.gz (http://www.lighttpd.net/)

Modifications to the base install:
  - Move cygwin1.dll (see no_dll/README)
  - Remove the docs/ directory
  - Added php5-cgi binary from php-5.2.6-Win32.zip (http://www.php.net)
  - Non-standard php.ini and shim code in php5/

--- For Mac ---
The Mac version of LigHTTPd depends on libpcre; build it and place a copy of
libpcre.0.dylib in mac/dylib.

The Mac version of LigHTTPd is built on intel from LightTPD 1.4.20 with the 
following configure options defined:
  --with-openssl
  --prefix=/tmp/lighttpd so a "make install" bundles it
     correctly
 
We then use install_name_tool to fix up the hardcoded library defined that
wants to look in /usr/local/lib

  $ install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/liblightcomp.dylib @executable_path/../lib/liblightcomp.dylib /tmp/lighttpd/sbin/lighttpd
 
This also needs to be done for many of the mac/lib/mod_* libraries.
install_name_tool may also be needed to adjust the path to libpcre.0.dylib to
be relative to @executable_path (@executable_path/../lib/libpcre.0.dylib).

The Mac version of php-cgi is built from PHP 5.2.6 with the following
configure options:

  --prefix=/tmp/php
  --enable-fastcgi
  --enable-sockets
  --enable-force-cgi-redirect

--- For Linux ---
Similar to the Mac version, grab the sources, configure, compile and move
binaries to the correct location in third_party/lighttpd/lnx/

LightTPD
 1) Uncompress
   gzip -cd lighttpd-1.4.20.tar.gz | tar xf -
 2) You may need some libs
   apt-get install libpcre3-dev   # required for pcre-devel
   apt-get install libbz2-dev     # required for bzip2-headers
 3) configure, make and install
   ./configure --with-openssl --prefix=/tmp/lighttpd_lnx
   make
   make install
 4) create directory and copy files
   cd third_party/lighttpd/
   mkdir lnx
   cd lnx
   mkdir bin
   mkdir lib
   cp /tmp/lighttpd_lnx/sbin/lighttpd bin/
   cp /tmp/lighttpd_lnx/lib/* lib/

PHP-CGI
 1) Uncompress 
   gzip -cd php-5.2.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
 2) you may need some libs
   apt-get install libxml2-dev     # required for xml2-config
 3) configure, make and install
   ./configure --prefix=/tmp/php_lnx \
               --enable-fastcgi \
               --enable-sockets \
               --enable-force-cgi-redirect
   make
   make install
 4) copy files
   cd third_party/lighttpd/lnx
   cp /tmp/php_lnx/bin/php_cgi bin/
   
Extra: You can now remove the directories where you compiled and installed.

The resulting libraries and executables are then copied into the third_party
dir in the source tree to mirror where the windows executables live. It's 
unfortunate that we can't build this all from source as part of the build
process, but the source isn't checked in for windows, so....
