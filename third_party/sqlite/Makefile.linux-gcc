# Makefile for SQLITE
#
# This is a template makefile for SQLite.  Most people prefer to
# use the autoconf generated "configure" script to generate the
# makefile automatically.  But that does not work for everybody
# and in every situation.  If you are having problems with the
# "configure" script, you might want to try this makefile as an
# alternative.  Create a copy of this file, edit the parameters
# below and type "make".

#    that contains this "Makefile.in" and the "configure.in" script.

#    call, then define the HAVE_USLEEP macro for all C modules.

#### If you want the SQLite library to be safe for use within a 
#    multi-threaded program, then define the following macro
#    appropriately:
#
#THREADSAFE = -DTHREADSAFE=1
THREADSAFE = -DTHREADSAFE=1

#### Specify any extra linker options needed to make the library
#    thread safe

#THREADLIB = -lpthread

#### Leave SQLITE_DEBUG undefined for maximum speed.  Use SQLITE_DEBUG=1
#    to check for memory leaks.  Use SQLITE_DEBUG=2 to print a log of all
#    malloc()s and free()s in order to track down memory leaks.
#    
#    SQLite uses some expensive assert() statements in the inner loop.
#    You can make the library go almost twice as fast if you compile
#    with -DNDEBUG=1
