This is Chrome's locally patched copy of Colin Percival's bspatch tool
(see ../bsdiff for the corresponding bsdiff tool).

Originally obtained from Mozilla's local copy/fork of bspatch; see:

The license is shared in common with bsdiff.

Local changes include CRC32 verification.

Update(08 Sep 08): Changed ApplyBinaryPatch to accept wchar_t paths
instead of char paths.
