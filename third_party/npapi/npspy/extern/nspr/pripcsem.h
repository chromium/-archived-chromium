 * Description: named semaphores for interprocess
 * synchronization
 *
 * Unrelated processes obtain access to a shared semaphore
 * by specifying its name.
 *
 * Our goal is to support named semaphores on at least
 * Unix and Win32 platforms.  The implementation will use
 * one of the three native semaphore APIs: POSIX, System V,
 * and Win32.
 *
 * Because POSIX named semaphores have kernel persistence,
 * we are forced to have a delete function in this API.
