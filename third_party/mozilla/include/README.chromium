This directory contains files needed for mozilla interfaces required
for the new Java Plugin APIs.

Definitions of frozen interfaces are copied from Gecko SDK 
http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.4/sdk/gecko-sdk-win32-msvc-1.8.0.4.zip

nscore.h
nsError.h
nsID.h
nsISupports.h
nsISupportsBase.h
nsrootidl.h
prcpucfg.h
prlong.h
prtime.h
prtypes.h
xpcom-config.h

The prtypes.h file was modified to include "base/basictypes.h" instead of
mozilla's protypes.h to avoid type clashes.

nsISupports.h was modified to remove inclusion of nsISupportsUtils.h to avoid
pulling in unnecessary headers and definitions.

Definitions of remaining interfaces are auto generated during compilation of
Mozilla source code. For convenience, these are copied from:
http://publicsvn.songbirdnest.com/browser/trunk/dependencies/win32/mozilla/debug/include/plugin?rev=1

nsICookieStorage.h
nsIPluginManager.h
nsIPluginManager2.h
nsplugindefs.h
nspluginroot.h

The following files come from mozilla/camino and are not part of the Gecko SDK:

NSWorkspace+Utils.h/m
