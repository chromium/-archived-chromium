This directory contains a partial snapshot of the libxslt library from
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT, with the following modification:
* Modified win32/configure.js to be able to clobber a read-only Makefile
* Modified libxslt/security.c to use GetFileAttributesA instead of GetFileAttributes. 
* Modified configure to not generate Makefiles.

Current version: 1.1.24

To import a new snapshot of libxslt:

- Visit http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html and download the latest source
  distribution.
- Copy the files into this directory, omitting files which have been omitted
  here.
- Run build/generate-win32-headers.bat to re-generate the configuration
  headers.
- 'cd linux && sh ../configure --with-libxml-src=../../libxml/linux/' to
  re-generate configuration headers.
