This directory contains files extracted from modp-base64-v2.0.0.tar.bz2,

See the header of modp_b64.cc for the license terms.

The modp_b64.c file was modified to remove the inclusion of modp's config.h
and to fix compilation errors that occur under VC8.  The file was renamed
modp_b64.cc to force it to be compiled as C++ so that the inclusion of
basictypes.h could be possible.

The file modp_b64_data.h was generated by modp_b64_gen.c (under Linux), which
is not included in this directory.  The resulting header was modified to remove
the "#include <stdint.h>" since that header file does not exist under VC8.  The
required typedefs for uint8_t and uint32_t were defined in its place.
