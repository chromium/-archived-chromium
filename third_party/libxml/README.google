This directory contains a partial snapshot of the libxml library from
http://xmlsoft.org, with the patch in google.patch applied. google.patch
includes the following modifications : 
* Modified encoding.c to fix memory leak (06/13/2008)
* Modified win32/configure.js NOT to use iconv
* Modified win32/configure.js to be able to clobber a read-only Makefile
* Changed 'LoadLibrary' to 'LoadLibraryA' in xmlmodule.c (used with
  'const char*' as an argument)
* Changed bogus '(unsigned long)' cast to '(unsigned short)' in xmlregexp.c
* Made it possible to use ICU converters instead of iconv. 
* Added nsParent member to _xmlParseCtxt in include/libxml/parser.h, 
  added a check to nsParent in xmlGetNamespace() in parser.c. 
  This allows parsed entities to inherit namespaces.
