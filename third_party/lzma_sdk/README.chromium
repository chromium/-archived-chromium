This contains a part of LZMA SDK 4.49.

Only the C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
compression has been included. The project files have been rewritten to use
proper file paths and generate a static lib.

The original source and license are available from
http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html. 

See the table in src/third_party/README.google for more details.
