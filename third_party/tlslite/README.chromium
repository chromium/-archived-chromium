This library was downloaded from http://trevp.net/tlslite/.

The code is public domain.

tlslite/TLSRecordLayer.py was changed to force the socket to be closed when the
SSL connection is closed. This is is necessary at this point since WinHTTP does
not seem to react to the SSL close notify.  It's also needed to prevent a hang
on Linux.  See also

The change is in google.patch.
