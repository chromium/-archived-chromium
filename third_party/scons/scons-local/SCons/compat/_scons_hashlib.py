hashlib backwards-compatibility module for older (pre-2.5) Python versions

This does not not NOT (repeat, *NOT*) provide complete hashlib
functionality.  It only wraps the portions of MD5 functionality used
by SCons, in an interface that looks like hashlib (or enough for our
purposes, anyway).  In fact, this module will raise an ImportError if
the underlying md5 module isn't available.
