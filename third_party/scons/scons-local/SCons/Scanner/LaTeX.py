    """Class for scanning LaTeX files for included files.

    Unlike most scanners, which use regular expressions that just
    return the included file name, this returns a tuple consisting
    of the keyword for the inclusion ("include", "includegraphics",
    "input", or "bibliography"), and then the file name itself.  
    Based on a quick look at LaTeX documentation, it seems that we 
    should append .tex suffix for the "include" keywords, append .tex if
    there is no extension for the "input" keyword, and need to add .bib
    for the "bibliography" keyword that does not accept extensions by itself.

    Finally, if there is no extension for an "includegraphics" keyword
    latex will append .ps or .eps to find the file, while pdftex may use .pdf,
    .jpg, .tif, .mps, or .png.
    
    The actual subset and search order may be altered by
    DeclareGraphicsExtensions command. This complication is ignored.
    The default order corresponds to experimentation with teTeX
        $ latex --version
        pdfeTeX 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)
        kpathsea version 3.5.4
    The order is:
        ['.eps', '.ps'] for latex
        ['.png', '.pdf', '.jpg', '.tif'].

    Another difference is that the search path is determined by the type
    of the file being searched:
    env['TEXINPUTS'] for "input" and "include" keywords
    env['TEXINPUTS'] for "includegraphics" keyword
    env['BIBINPUTS'] for "bibliography" keyword
    env['BSTINPUTS'] for "bibliographystyle" keyword
