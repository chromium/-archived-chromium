2. Installing 
-------------
     This install requires fcgp, which means the target kernel src must be on
the system creating the map.

     Download and copy the new files into the fcgp directory, (Note: its always
a good idea to have backups). 

     Run genflat.pl against your kernel info files
        ./genflat.pl kernel.info kernel2.info > coverage.dat

     Run the make command for the fcgp (Note: this can take a while)
        make KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux

     Update posterize.pl as needed, normally page size, margins, titles.
Most of these settings will be broken out as command line options in the future.

     Run posterize.pl this will generate the file poster.ps.

3. Notes and Comments
---------------------
     This is a quick and dirty implementation suited for my needs. It does not
perform any of the tiling the original did.
