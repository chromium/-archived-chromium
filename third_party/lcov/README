Description
-----------
  LCOV is an extension of GCOV, a GNU tool which provides information about
  what parts of a program are actually executed (i.e. "covered") while running
  a particular test case. The extension consists of a set of PERL scripts
  which build on the textual GCOV output to implement the following enhanced
  functionality:

    * HTML based output: coverage rates are additionally indicated using bar
      graphs and specific colors.

    * Support for large projects: overview pages allow quick browsing of
      coverage data by providing three levels of detail: directory view,
      file view and source code view.

  LCOV was initially designed to support Linux kernel coverage measurements,
  but works as well for coverage measurements on standard user space
  applications.

2. Installing LCOV
------------------
The LCOV package is available as either RPM or tarball from:
     
  http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php

To install the tarball, unpack it to a directory and run:

  make install

Use anonymous CVS for the most recent (but possibly unstable) version:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ltp login

(simply press the ENTER key when asked for a password)

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ltp export -D now utils

Change to the utils/analysis/lcov directory and type:

  make install


3. An example of how to access kernel coverage data
---------------------------------------------------
Requirements: get and install the gcov-kernel package from

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltp

Copy the resulting gcov kernel module file to either the system wide modules
directory or the same directory as the PERL scripts. As root, do the following:

  a) Resetting counters

     lcov --zerocounters

  b) Capturing the current coverage state to a file

     lcov --capture --output-file kernel.info

  c) Getting HTML output

     genhtml kernel.info

Point the web browser of your choice to the resulting index.html file.


4. An example of how to access coverage data for a user space program
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: compile the program in question using GCC with the options
-fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage. Assuming the compile directory is called
"appdir", do the following:

  a) Resetting counters

     lcov --directory appdir --zerocounters

  b) Capturing the current coverage state to a file (works only after the
     application has been started and stopped at least once)

     lcov --directory appdir --capture --output-file app.info

  c) Getting HTML output

     genhtml app.info

Point the web browser of your choice to the resulting index.html file.
