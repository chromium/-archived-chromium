Harfbuzz requires several functions to be defined in order to work with the
platform's Unicode tables etc.

If you are building on top of Qt4 you should look at the code in the tests/
directory for examples of how to hook up Qt4 functions to Harfbuzz.

Otherwise, this directory contains examples of using downloaded Unicode tables
and/or glib to host Harfbuzz. You should read the README file in tables/ for how
to build the header files for some of the Unicode tables.
