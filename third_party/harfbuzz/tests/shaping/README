These shaper tests need some specific TrueType fonts. You can get a package of
them from

        http://people.freedesktop.org/~hausmann/harfbuzz-test-fonts-0.1.tar.bz2

In addition you may need two fonts (Mangal and Tunga) from Microsoft Windows
for some of the test cases. These fonts are not freely redistributable.

The test program looks for them in a fonts/ subdirectory.
