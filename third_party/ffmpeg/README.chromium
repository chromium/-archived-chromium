This contains FFmpeg's public header files from the output of a "make install"
command.  The header files are from Chromium's copy of FFmpeg.

Steps to reproduce:
  1) If on Windows, refer to our MinGW/MSYS environment setup:
       http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/mingw/
  2) Grab Chromium's copy of FFmpeg:
       http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/ffmpeg/
  3) Follow the instructions to build and install.
  4) Go to your install location and copy the following into the Chromium tree:
       /path/to/install/include/libavcodec
       /path/to/install/include/libavformat
       /path/to/install/include/libavutil

The project contains some hand-written DEF files used to generate import
libraries to permit dynamically loading FFmpeg.  The libaries are linked in
using /DELAYLOAD to avoid having the DLLs present at run-time.

We don't use the import libraries generated from building FFmpeg because they
export every method by ordinal, which makes binary compatability with different
builds of FFmpeg difficult if not impossible.  Furthermore, it is much easier
to update a DEF file instead of rebuilding FFmpeg to generate new import
libraries.
